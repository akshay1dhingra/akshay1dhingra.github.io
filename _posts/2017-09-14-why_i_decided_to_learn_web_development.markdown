A wise person once told me, the key to a fulfilling career involves three things: growth potential, enjoyment, and it should pay well. I did not take this advice too seriously once I had graduated from college during the base of the great recession; I was focusing on surviving. I took jobs that seemed to allow career growth, but ended up being dull and uninspiring. As I was trying to turn my career around, I remembered this quote and it inspired me to do some soul searching, which landed me on my path to become a web developer.

My background is in sales with very little exposure to html on a certain social media site in the early 2000s. My father and my cousin are both developers, and when I told them that I was dabbling in coding they were very supportive. My cousin, who himself was a college dropout turned Hack Reactor graduate, encouraged me to go into web development and learn Javascript. He pointed me towards codecademy to see if I actually enjoyed learning to code. After a few modules on codecademy, I became addicted. 

I graduated from a university about 5 years ago, and though I do not miss writing papers, the late nights, and cramming for exams, I did miss that feeling of learning something new. Every "AHA!" moment quickly followed by overwhelming joy and bliss, gaining enough EXP to grow another level. I did not realize I missed that feeling so much until I started learning web development. I then decided to take it a step further and join the Free Code Camp.

FCC has a great community that is structured similarily to Flatiron School. They have open source, real world projects that are then used by non-profits. They also teach you to build a portfolio to present to potential hiring managers. But they were lacking in quite a few areas, such as technical help and study groups. I find value in having 1 on 1 time with instructors to talk through the code to understand what is happening. Every time I got stuck on FCC, I was left on my own and could not fully understand why certain code did what... My cousin understood my quolms as he went through the same thing in the beginning of his journey, and he encouraged me to join a bootcamp. After a solid year of researching different camps, Flatiron School seemed like the best choice. I am thrilled to be apart of this community and looking forward to tackling this curriculum with all of you.
