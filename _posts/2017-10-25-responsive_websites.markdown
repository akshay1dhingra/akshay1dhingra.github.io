Building Responsive Sites is a necessity now given that people browse the internet on multiple devices. From desktops to laptops, tablets, and smart phones, the user experience is what will set your work apart from others. Websites need to be able to react to different screen sizes, and display a website format specially for that screen size, in order to present clear websites.

A Responsive Site is a page that can be viewed on different devises. Devise Detection is done on the server side by looking at the header info to dertermine what device the webpage is being accessed from. 

There are two methods for building responsive sites:

**Desktop Down**: In desktop down, also known as Graceful Degradation, the site is first designed to fit desktop devices then scaled down as the screen gets smaller to fit on smaller devices. We can change elements to a fluid width or switch from a multi column to a single column structure. 

**Mobile Up**: In mobile up, also known as Progressive Enhancements, the site is first designed to fit mobile devices and as the screen gets bigger, the layout of the page changes to fit that screen. This is done by adding content or moving conent around. 

The deciding factor on whether you design a desktop down or mobile up site will be based on where the majority of your visitors will be accessing your page from, and which device will they most likely be using.

For example, if you are a new record label that displays more music content than merchendise, you may advertise on spotify or facebook where the majority of users are already on their mobile device and will click on your link and take you to you rpage directly. You will most likely design your site Mobile Up to cater this sort of traffic. 

However, if you are a large retail store, most of your site traffic will come from google searches, or visitors going directly to your site. In this case, it would be better to build a Desktop Down design, since most visitors will be using their home computer or laptop.
