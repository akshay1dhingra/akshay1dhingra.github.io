The name of the game is to build, break, and fix over and over again. And sometimes, its okay to walk away from the computer for a moment so you can come back with a new perspective. This project definitely tested me on that amongst many many things. 

There is a bit of zen involved in knowing when to get up and take a breather. I often find myself falling into a state of mania when I run into an issue, and brute force my way to the solution too many times. More often than not, I find the solution after a moment away to collect my thoughts.

For this project, I decided to focus on making the application for users to review their favorite board or video games. 

The process of building this app from scratch was, honestly, a bit scary at first. But when things start slowly getting pieced together, you and you see your desired outcome actually work in front of your eyes, there are a few things in life that are as satisfying as seeing your code come to life. 

Overall, I am very happy with this application. There is not a lot of unecessary code and features, while there were a few things that were fun challenges (scope methods to view reviews in descending order by score). I am looking forward to coming back to this project to add more functionality.
