I am nearly done with the Sinatra section of the bootcamp and I must say that I understand why developers choose to use frameworks to deploy their apps. Going from plain old Ruby, where I learned how things like the Yield function is actually working "under the hood", to using Sinatra and Active Record to quickly build objects that assume relationships and persist data without having to build out each SQL query is truly "magical". 

In the real world, it is no secret that product teams are often given dead-lines that may or may not always seems achievable. In order for teams to ship out products and features to meet the business needs of their clients or the market, having a firm understanding of how to use a framework like Sinatra, ALONG WITH a proper understanding of how the framework was built is invaluable. 

Frameworks allow developers to become more efficient. But what if one day the framework vanishes? Or the next new framework becomes widely adopted and your client wants that shiny new toy? Having the foundational understanding of how to build methods and write code in the original language (like Ruby or Javascript) will allow you to pick up that new framework, or even a new language with greater ease.
